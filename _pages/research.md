Local Effects of Bypassing Zoning Regulations, with [Noémie Sportiche](https://noemiesportiche.netlify.app/) \[[SSRN link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4906689)\] <br> *Revise and resubmit, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*

<br> <sub>Prior research shows that restrictive zoning regulations are major drivers of rising housing costs and residential segregation in the United States. In response, a growing number of state and local governments are passing laws to allow for denser housing in strictly zoned localities, despite entrenched opposition from incumbent residents. This paper examines whether incumbent residents' responses undermine the success of these policies by studying new construction permitted under Massachusetts Chapter 40B; one of the longest-standing and most productive examples of a housing policy that bypasses local zoning laws. Exploiting hyperlocal variation in residents' proximity to new 40B buildings, we find that only a subset of larger 40B developments cause property values to decrease, and that this effect is both highly localized and only emerges in the longer term, many years after these developments are proposed. Focusing on these larger developments that are more likely to elicit resident reactions, we find that only a fraction of incumbent residents move out after their approval and that the magnitude of these migration responses is insufficient to undermine policymakers' desegregation goals. We also do not find evidence that incumbent residents become more politically active against future development, as they are no more likely to vote in local or general elections nor are they more likely to vote for repealing Chapter 40B after 40B developments are proposed near their homes.</sub>

Discrimination Against Housing Vouchers: Evidence from Online Rental Listings, with [Jaehee Song](https://www.jaeheesong.com/) \[[SSRN link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4819763)\] 
<!--
<br> <sub>The Housing Choice Voucher program provides substantial rental subsidies to low-income households, yet many recipients struggle to secure housing with their vouchers, particularly in low-poverty areas. This paper examines a key bottleneck in the program: landlord discrimination against voucher holders. Using a nationwide dataset from a major online rental platform, we identify listings that explicitly seek or reject voucher holders. We find significant variation across metropolitan areas, with voucher-seeking listings ranging from nearly zero to 18 percent and voucher-rejecting listings ranging from nearly zero to 28 percent. Within metros, landlords in high-poverty neighborhoods with larger Black and voucher populations are more likely to seek voucher holders, while rejection of voucher holders is relatively more common in low-poverty neighborhoods. Using a difference-in-differences design, we provide causal evidence that statewide prohibitions on source-of-income discrimination significantly reduce explicit rejection of vouchers. This reduction is particularly pronounced in low-poverty neighborhoods and can eliminate cross-neighborhood disparities in discriminatory behavior.</sub>

<details> <summary> <i>Local Effects of Bypassing Zoning Regulations in High-Income Areas</i>, with <a href="[https://Example.com](https://noemiesportiche.netlify.app/)"><mark class="color:blue;">Noémie Sportiche</p></mark> </summary> <sub> An increasing number of jurisdictions are passing regulations to allow for denser housing in high-income areas. This paper examines how local house prices and existing residents -who are often strongly opposed to these policies- react to this new construction. We focus on housing constructed under Chapter 40B, a Massachusetts state policy that requires all municipalities to maintain a minimum proportion of affordable housing and allows developers to bypass local zoning regulations if those minimums are not met. Using a difference-in-differences design that compares housing located near 40B developments to housing located slightly farther away paired with rich individual-level data, we provide two sets of results. First, large 40B developments lead to substantial decreases in nearby house prices, while smaller developments do not affect prices. Second, nearby residents respond by moving out at higher rates after large 40B developments are constructed, although we do not observe significant changes in existing residents’ political participation at the state or federal level. </sub> </details>

Redistribution through Housing Assistance, with [Juliette Fournier](https://juliettefournier.site/)
<br>
<br>
* &quot;**Redistribution through Housing Assistance**&quot; <br > *joint with [Juliette Fournier](https://juliettefournier.site/)* <br > **Abstract**: We examine the distributional implications of the shift from public housing to subsidized private housing initiated by the U.S. government over the past few decades. We build a quantitative urban framework where housing assistance complements income taxation to redistribute across workers. We argue that provision of affordable housing involves a trade-off between indirect pecuniary redistribution and direct amenity spin-offs. On the one hand, public housing drives local rents down, while amplifying the spatial concentration of poverty. On the other hand, project- and tenant-based rental assistance enhances the local amenities of subsidized households by promoting mixed-income communities, but pushes private landowners’ rents up.
