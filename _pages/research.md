*Knocking it Down and Mixing it Up: The Impact of Public Housing Regenerations* (with [Lorenzo Neri](https://lneri.weebly.com/)) \[[Link](/files/20211105_Paper_London_Regenerations.pdf)\] <br> <sub> This paper studies the effects of regenerating public housing into mixed-income communities on the local housing market. We exploit a wave of public housing regenerations in London that not only demolish and rebuild existing public housing but also almost double the number of units on-site with new market-rate units. Over a six-year period, we estimate that regenerations significantly raise nearby house prices and rents, although house prices decrease slightly farther away. We also find that they attract higher-income households, increase positive amenities (e.g., cafés, restaurants), and reduce negative amenities (e.g., crime). The results are consistent with strong demand effects concentrated near the buildings and moderate effects from increased supply that persist in the broader area. We provide suggestive evidence that changes in a neighborhood's socioeconomic composition are important to explain price effects: regenerations in low-income areas and those adding a large number of market-rate units lead to larger price increases. Overall, our findings indicate that mixed-income housing can revitalize neighborhoods near decaying public housing, but the supply of new market-rate units can increase unaffordability in low-income neighborhoods. </sub> <br>

*Local Effects of Bypassing Zoning Regulations in High-Income Areas* (with [Noémie Sportiche](https://noemiesportiche.netlify.app/)) <br> <sub> An increasing number of jurisdictions are passing regulations to allow for denser housing in high-income areas. This paper examines how local house prices and existing residents -who are often strongly opposed to these policies- react to this new construction. We focus on housing constructed under Chapter 40B, a Massachusetts state policy that requires all municipalities to maintain a minimum proportion of affordable housing and allows developers to bypass local zoning regulations if those minimums are not met. Using a difference-in-differences design that compares housing located near 40B developments to housing located slightly farther away paired with rich individual-level data, we provide two sets of results. First, large 40B developments lead to substantial decreases in nearby house prices, while smaller developments do not affect prices. Second, nearby residents respond by moving out at higher rates after large 40B developments are constructed, although we do not observe any significant changes in existing residents’ political participation at the state or federal level. </sub>

*Redistribution through Housing Assistance* (with [Juliette Fournier](https://juliettefournier.site/)) <br> <sub> We examine the distributional implications of the shift from public housing to subsidized private housing initiated by the U.S. government over the past few decades. We build a quantitative urban framework where housing assistance complements income taxation to redistribute across workers. We argue that provision of affordable housing involves a trade-off between indirect pecuniary redistribution and direct amenity spin-offs. On the one hand, public housing drives local rents down, while amplifying the spatial concentration of poverty. On the other hand, project- and tenant-based rental assistance enhances the local amenities of subsidized households by promoting mixed-income communities, but pushes private landowners’ rents up. </sub>
