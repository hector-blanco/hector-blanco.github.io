Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Rutgers University. I am also a Research Affiliate at CESifo and NYU Furman Center. My areas of interest are public economics and urban economics, with a special focus on housing. My current research studies how affordable housing policies shape neighborhoods and the lives of their residents.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at NYU Furman Center. I graduated with a PhD in Economics from MIT in 2022.
