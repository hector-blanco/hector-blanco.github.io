Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at MIT. My areas of interest are public economics and urban economics. My current research focuses on how affordable housing policies shape neighborhoods and their residents. 

In June 2022, I will join the Furman Center at New York University as a postdoctoral research fellow.

You can contact me at [hblanco@mit.edu](mailto:hblanco@mit.edu).
