Hello! I am a postdoctoral research fellow at NYU Furman Center. My areas of interest are public economics and urban economics. My current research focuses on how affordable housing policies shape neighborhoods and the lives of their residents. 

I graduated with a PhD in Economics from MIT in 2022. Previously, I earned a M.S. in Economics from the Barcelona School of Economics in 2016 and a B.S. in Economics and Laws from Universitat Pompeu Fabra in 2015. 

In summer 2023, I will join the Department of Economics at Rutgers University as an Assistant Professor.
